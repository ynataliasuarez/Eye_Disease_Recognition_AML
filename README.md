# Eye Disease Recognition AML
## Abstract
The classification of eye disease is a fundamental process in medicine to be able to take the necessary actions, regarding the patient, additionally, it has an incidence 2.2 billion of people in the world, which is why this article it is proposed to use of deep learning through networks convolutional, specifically using the Resnet50 network, to perform its classification automatically between Normal, Diabetes, Glaucoma, Cataract, Macular Degeneration (AMD), Hypertension, Myopia, Other diseases was used a dataset provided by Shanggong Medical Technology Co. Ltd, obtaining a final result of 68.9\% in the average of F1-metrics, Kappa metrics, and AUC metric.   Additionally was evaluated Stargan network in the generation of retinal images affects AMD, Hypertension, and Myopia.
